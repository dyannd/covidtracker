# COVID TRACKER
## The project displays basic info of the COVID-19 situation of a country, including confirmed cases, recovered, and deaths.
I built this project to practice calling third-party API, particularly that from https://mmediagroup.fr/covid-19. 
Also, this is my first time deploying a React app. I worked with React Hooks and States to query for the data after choosing a country.
Overall, I had a lot of fun doing this project!
